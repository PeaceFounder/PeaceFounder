To assert that votes have been  accuratelly counted and that only legitimate voters have participated an audit takes place.\n\nEvery voter after ellections receives a final tally together with a consistency proof  which proves that their vote is included in the ledger which have produced the tally.  From the voter client voter reads four important parameters for the ballotbox:\n\ndeme_uuid: an UUID of the deme where the proposal is registered;\nproposal_index: a index at which the proposal is recorded in the braidchain ledger;\nledger_length: a number of collected votes in the ledger;\nledger_root: a ballotbox ledger root checksum.\n\nThe auditor also knows a hasher deme uses to make checksums which is immutable at the moment deme is created.\n\nLet's consider abstract functions to retrieve ballotbox and braidchain ledger archives from the internet with get_ballotbox_archive and get_braidchain_archive then the auditing can be done with a following script:\n\nbraidchain_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid)\nballotbox_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid, proposal_index)[1:ledger_length]\n\n@test checksum(ballotbox_archive, hasher) == ledger_root\n@test isbinding(braidchain_archive, ballotbox_archive, hasher)\n\nspec = crypto(braidchain_archive)\n\n@test audit(ballotbox_archive, spec)\n@test audit(braidchain_archive)\n\n@show tally(ballotbox_archive)\n\nNote that spec is read from the DemeSpec record in the braidchain which can be trusted as  the tree braidchain ledger checksum is listed within a proposal's anchor. The proposal is  the first record in history tree for the ballotbox thus it is bound to ledger_root  checksum and so demespec record is also tied to ledger_root.\n\nFor convinience an audit method is provided which audits both archives at the same time:\n\nbraidchain_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid)\nballotbox_archive = get_ballotbox_archive(uuid, proposal_index)[1:ledger_length]\n\n@test checksum(ballotbox_archive, hasher) == ledger_root\n@test audit(braidchain_archive, ballotbox_archive, hasher)\n\n@show tally(ballotbox_archive)\n\nNote that this audit does not check honesty of the registrar that it have not admitted fake users to gain more influence in the ellection result. Properties being verified by the audit:\n\nLegitimacy: only and all eligiable voters cast their votes;\nFairness: every eligiable voter can vote at most once;\nImmutability: no vote can be deleted or modified when recorded in the ledger; \nTallied as Cast: all cast votes are counted honestly to predetermined procedure; \nSoftware independence: the previously audited properties for the evidence does not \n\ndepend on a trust in honest execution of peacefounder service nor honesty of the braiders who provides new pseudonyms for the deme members. In other words the previously listed  properties would not be altered if adversary would have a full control over the peacefounder  service and the braiders. \n\nThe immutability is ensured from voter's clients updating their consistency proof chain which includes their vote. If the vote gets removed from a chain every single voter who had cast their vote would get a proof for inconsistent ledger state called blame. The blame can be made public by the voter without revealing it's vote and thus ensures immutability and also persitance after votes are published. The auditable part here are the votes themselves signed with pseudonym which contract voter's clients to follow up at latter periods with consistency proofs. On top of that, other monitors can synchronize the ballotbox ledger and add assurances that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"audittools/#PeaceFounder.AuditTools.BallotBoxArchive","page":"PeaceFounder.AuditTools","title":"PeaceFounder.AuditTools.BallotBoxArchive","text":"struct BallotBoxArchive\n    proposal::Proposal\n    seed::Digest\n    ledger::Vector{CastRecord}\nend\n\nRepresents a ballotbox ledger archive.

Often the e-voting systems are designed as a two-step process where in the first step, voters cast encrypted votes, and, in the second step, the encrypted ballots are shuffled between different independent parties for anonymity and then decrypted. However, in these systems' privacy, transparency, and security remain in tension. Making all evidence public would violate the right of voters to keep their decision to participate secret, whereas including more parties who collectively decrypt the votes to ensure the anonymity of the voters could open adversaries an opportunity to prevent the election result from being decrypted or to assemble the entire decryption key providing means to know how exactly each voter had voted. ","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"An alternative approach is to anonymise voters instead of votes who cast them with a pseudonym. So far, proposed systems have focused on one-time large-scale elections where the relative generator is predetermined at the registration phase. That reduces complexity for the voter but puts a burden on the election authority to coordinate honest execution of re-encryption shuffle and threshold decryption between all involved parties. Although honesty of execution is guaranteed with zero-knowledge proofs, it does not prevent adversary-sabotaged communication issues. Thus, some baseline of trust is necessary for mixes to guarantee the reliability of the mix phase. ","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"PeaceFounder system differs from existing solutions by doing public key anonymisation for one mix at a time, after which the relative generator, zero-knowledge shuffle, and decryption proofs are published to the bulletin board. Since there is no coordination between mixes, it makes the protocol more reliable. It is important to note that this also makes the anonymisation easier to understand and more accessible to a broader audience as the mixing procedure is local and can be viewed as a function braid(generator, members) -> (new_generator, new_members) that can be visually represented as a knot-tying together multiple threads.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"The PeaceFounder system demonstrates the feasibility of continuously enrolling new members who are anonymised equally with other members in subsequent mixings. The bulletin board is implemented as a Merkle tree where every new member, braid and proposal are recorded in a ledger, forming a transactional database available to everyone to verify. The clients are thin and use Merkle tree inclusion proofs to assert their membership and to get proof that an election authority provides a given proposal and can be held accountable for its correctness, including the relative generator with which the votes are being cast. To assert the integrity of the bulletin board, the clients would periodically download Merkle consistency proofs from the election authority.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"PeaceFounder.jl","title":"PeaceFounder.jl","text":"One of the significant advantages of the PeaceFounder system over existing solutions is that a single person can deploy and maintain this system without compromising privacy, security or transparency. It does not rely on the trust of the honest execution of the ceremony for the setup parameters as it is with some cryptocurrency systems, nor does the need to coordinate correct threshold decryption between multiple parties as needed for a re-encryption-based mixnet voting system. This makes it more accessible to smaller communities which want to offer strong software-independent evidence to everyone and assure the members that their vote is anonymous, guaranteed with multiple braids made in different geographical locations.

Also, it is easy for the administrator to design procedures in which proposals get accepted for the members to vote and display the progress of the current and past proposals as they are being run. Even more unlimited options to design preferential cardinal or budget-constrained ballots are available while ensuring that election evidence provides software independence for everyone. Meanwhile, the votes are cast within a client GUI application offering security and privacy guarantees for the voters.
